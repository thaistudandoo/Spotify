# Spotify Data Exploration ðŸŽ¶ - #7DaysOfCode

This repository contains the exploration of Spotify music data, where we perform analysis, visualizations, and extract insights on the musical characteristics and popularity of songs on the platform. Here you will find the source code, datasets used, and detailed documentation.

#  Project Description
In this project, we explore Spotify music data to gain a better understanding of the factors that influence song popularity. Using techniques such as exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and descriptive statistics, we investigate musical features like duration, danceability, energy, genre, popular artists, and other relevant aspects. The goal is to gain insights into what makes a song popular on Spotify and how these characteristics relate.
